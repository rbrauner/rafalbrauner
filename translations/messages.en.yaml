    interests:
        title: Interests
        first: My passion is the Backend Development, in which I feel like a fish in water. Designing the structure of the application code, database models, as well as keeping code clean are things that I meet daily. I am also interested in topics in the field of cyber security or technological news (not related to programming).
        second: When I am not programming I like to go on long, adventurous bicycle trips, as well as cross the mountain trails, and in winter I love skiing. Moreover I will gladly watch a good movie / series, or read a book telling an interesting fantasy story.
